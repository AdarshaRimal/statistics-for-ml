# Probability Distribution Functions

## Random Variable
A random variable is a numerical value determined by the outcome of a random phenomenon or experiment. It's a way to quantify randomness. In other words, it represents possible outcomes of an experiment and assigns numerical values to these outcomes.

**Example:**
Imagine you roll a six-sided die. The outcome of the roll (which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is a random variable because the result is determined by chance.

If we call this random variable \( X \), then:
- \( X \) can take the value 1 if you roll a 1.
- \( X \) can take the value 2 if you roll a 2.
- And so on, until \( X \) can take the value 6 if you roll a 6.

### Algebraic Variable
An algebraic variable, on the other hand, is a symbol used to represent a number in mathematical expressions and equations. The value of an algebraic variable is typically unknown until you solve the equation or expression.

**Example:**
Consider the equation \( y = 3x + 2 \). Here, \( x \) and \( y \) are algebraic variables:
- \( x \) can represent any real number.
- Once you know the value of \( x \), you can calculate the value of \( y \).

### Key Differences
1. **Deterministic vs. Random:** 
   - **Random Variable:** The value is determined by a random process.
   - **Algebraic Variable:** The value is typically unknown but is determined by solving an equation or expression.

2. **Context of Use:**
   - **Random Variable:** Often used in probability and statistics.
   - **Algebraic Variable:** Used in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics.

# Probability Distribution Function

A **Probability Distribution Function** (PDF) describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. The function provides the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. For a continuous random variable \(X\), the PDF, denoted as \(f(x)\), provides the probability density at each value of \(X\).

## Properties of PDF

1. **Non-Negativity**: The value of the PDF is always non-negative.
   

\[
   f(x) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } x
   \]



2. **Normalization**: The total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1.
   

\[
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = 1
   \]



3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that the random variable \(X\) falls within a particular range \([a, b]\) is given by the integral of the PDF over that range.
   

\[
   P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
   \]



## Example: Normal Distribution

One of the most commonly used probability distribution functions is the **Normal Distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian Distribution**. It is characterized by its bell-shaped curve and is defined by its mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\).

The PDF of a normal distribution is given by:


\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
\]



Here, \(\mu\) represents the mean and \(\sigma\) represents the standard deviation.

### Example Calculation

Assume we have a normally distributed random variable \(X\) with mean \(\mu = 0\) and standard deviation \(\sigma = 1\). The PDF of \(X\) is:



\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{x^2}{2} \right)
\]



To find the probability that \(X\) lies between \(-1\) and \(1\), we calculate the integral of the PDF over this range:



\[
P(-1 \leq X \leq 1) = \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{x^2}{2} \right) dx
\]



This integral can be evaluated using numerical methods or lookup tables for the standard normal distribution. The result is approximately 0.6826, which means there's about a 68.26% chance that \(X\) lies within one standard deviation of the mean.
