# Probability Distribution Functions

## Random Variable
A random variable is a numerical value determined by the outcome of a random phenomenon or experiment. It's a way to quantify randomness. In other words, it represents possible outcomes of an experiment and assigns numerical values to these outcomes.

**Example:**
Imagine you roll a six-sided die. The outcome of the roll (which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is a random variable because the result is determined by chance.

If we call this random variable \( X \), then:
- \( X \) can take the value 1 if you roll a 1.
- \( X \) can take the value 2 if you roll a 2.
- And so on, until \( X \) can take the value 6 if you roll a 6.

### Algebraic Variable
An algebraic variable, on the other hand, is a symbol used to represent a number in mathematical expressions and equations. The value of an algebraic variable is typically unknown until you solve the equation or expression.

**Example:**
Consider the equation \( y = 3x + 2 \). Here, \( x \) and \( y \) are algebraic variables:
- \( x \) can represent any real number.
- Once you know the value of \( x \), you can calculate the value of \( y \).

### Key Differences
1. **Deterministic vs. Random:** 
   - **Random Variable:** The value is determined by a random process.
   - **Algebraic Variable:** The value is typically unknown but is determined by solving an equation or expression.

2. **Context of Use:**
   - **Random Variable:** Often used in probability and statistics.
   - **Algebraic Variable:** Used in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics.

### Summary
- **Random Variable:** A variable whose value is a result of a random phenomenon (e.g., rolling a die).
- **Algebraic Variable:** A variable representing an unknown number in an equation or expression (e.g., \( x \) in \( y = 3x + 2 \)).
