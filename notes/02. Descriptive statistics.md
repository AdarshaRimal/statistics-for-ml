## Descriptive Statistics

*Descriptive statistics is the process of summarizing and organizing data to make it easier to understand. It helps in analyzing past data without making predictions.*

**Example:**

*Imagine you have test scores of 5 students: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88*

- **Mean (Average)** = *(85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88) / 5 = 86.6*
- **Median (Middle Value)** = *First, sort the scores: 78, 85, 88, 90, 92. The middle value is 88.*
- **Mode (Most Frequent Value)** = *None (since no number repeats)*

*These values describe the dataset without making any future predictions.*

### 1. Measure of Central Tendency

*A measure of central tendency represents the typical or central value of a dataset. It provides a summary of the data by identifying a single value that is most representative of the dataset as a whole.*

#### i) Mean (Average)

*The mean is calculated as:*
$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum \text{All Values}}{\text{Number of Values}}$$

**Population Mean (𝜇) vs. Sample Mean (𝑥̄):**

- *Population Mean (𝜇) → Mean of the entire dataset (all individuals).*
- *Sample Mean (𝑥̄) → Mean of a subset (sample) taken from the population.*

![population mean vs sample mean](../images/population-mean.png)
**Example:**

*Test scores: 80, 85, 90, 95, 100*

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100}{5} = \frac{450}{5} = 90$$

⚠️ *Problem with Mean: Outliers Affect It*

*The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), which can distort the representation of the dataset.*

**Example:**

- *Without Outlier: 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 → Mean = 90*
- *With Outlier: 80, 85, 90, 95, 200 → Mean = 110 (inflated due to 200)*

*Since one extreme value (200) shifted the mean significantly, it no longer represents the dataset accurately.*

*This is why, in datasets with outliers, median is often preferred.*

[Mean  Code (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

### ii) Median

*The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves, ensuring that 50% of the values are below it and 50% are above it.*

*The median is calculated as:*

$$
\text{Median} = \begin{cases} 
\text{Middle value,} & \text{if the dataset has an odd number of values} \\
\frac{\text{Middle two values sum}}{2}, & \text{if the dataset has an even number of values}
\end{cases}
$$



**Example:**

- *Odd number of values:*
  - *Data: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30*
  - *Middle value = 20 (Median)*

- *Even number of values:*
  - *Data: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35*
  - *Middle two values = 20, 25*
  - *Median = (20 + 25) / 2 = 22.5*

**Why is Median Better for Handling Outliers?**

*The median is not affected by outliers because it only depends on the middle position, not on the actual values.*

**Example:**

- *Without Outlier: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 → Median = 20*
- *With Outlier: 10, 15, 20, 25, 300 → Median = 20 (Same as before!)*

*Unlike the mean, which would be heavily pulled by 300, the median remains stable, making it a better measure of central tendency for skewed data or datasets with outliers.*

[Median  Code (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

### iii) Mode

*The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.*

- *Unlike mean and median, the mode represents the most common value rather than a central point.*
- *It is particularly useful for categorical data (e.g., most common color, most purchased product).*
- *In numerical data, a dataset can have multiple modes (bimodal, multimodal) or no mode if all values appear equally.*

**Example:**

- ✅ *Mode in Categorical Data:*

  - *Favorite Fruits in a Class: 🍎, 🍌, 🍎, 🍊, 🍎, 🍊, 🍌, 🍎*
  - *Mode = "Apple" (🍎) (since it appears most frequently)*

- ✅ *Mode in Numerical Data:*
  - *Data: 4, 7, 8, 7, 6, 7, 9, 10*
  - *Mode = 7 (because it appears the most: 3 times)*

- ✅ *No Mode Example:*
  - *Data: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → No mode (all values appear once).*

[Mode  Code (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

### iv) Weighted Mean

*The weighted mean is a type of mean where some values contribute more importance (weight) than others. Instead of each value being equally important (as in simple mean), each value is multiplied by its assigned weight, and the sum is divided by the total weight.*

**Formula for Weighted Mean:**
$$\bar{X}_w = \frac{\sum (X_i \times W_i)}{\sum W_i}$$

*Where:*

- *\(X_i\) = Each value*
- *\(W_i\) = Corresponding weight*
- *\(\sum W_i\) = Total sum of weights*

**Example 1: Football Player Market Value Predictor**

*Suppose we are building a Football Player Market Value Predictor using three machine learning algorithms:*

- *Linear Regression → Weight = 0.2 (Less reliable)*
- *Random Forest → Weight = 0.3 (Moderately reliable)*
- *XGBoost → Weight = 0.5 (Most reliable)*

*These models predict a player's market value as:*

- *Linear Regression: $50M*
- *Random Forest: $55M*
- *XGBoost: $60M*

**Weighted Mean Calculation:**
$$\frac{(50 \times 0.2) + (55 \times 0.3) + (60 \times 0.5)}{0.2 + 0.3 + 0.5} = \frac{10 + 16.5 + 30}{1} = 56.5M$$

✅ *Final Predicted Market Value = $56.5M (Weighted Average)*

**Example 2: Student's Final Grade Calculation**

*A student's final grade is based on Assignments (weight: 30%), Midterm (weight: 30%), and Final Exam (weight: 40%). The scores are:*

- *Assignments: 85*
- *Midterm: 78*
- *Final Exam: 92*

**Weighted Mean Calculation:**
$$\frac{(85 \times 0.3) + (78 \times 0.3) + (92 \times 0.4)}{0.3 + 0.3 + 0.4} = \frac{25.5 + 23.4 + 36.8}{1} = 85.7$$

✅ *Final Grade = 85.7 (Weighted Average)*

[Weighted mean  Code (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

### v) Trimmed Mean

📌 *What is Trimmed Mean?*

*The trimmed mean is a modified version of the arithmetic mean where we remove a certain percentage of the smallest and largest values from the dataset before calculating the mean.*

*This helps to reduce the impact of outliers, making the mean more robust and representative of the majority of the data.*

🔢 *Formula for Trimmed Mean:*

1. *Sort the dataset in ascending order.*
2. *Remove a certain percentage (e.g., 10%) of the smallest and largest values.*
3. *Compute the mean of the remaining values.*

$$\text{Trimmed Mean} = \frac{\sum \text{Remaining Values}}{\text{Number of Remaining Values}}$$

**Example 1: Removing Outliers in Athlete Running Speeds**

*Suppose we measure the speeds (in km/h) of 10 athletes in a 100m race:*

*[24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 50, 29, 26, 100, 31]*

- *The values 50 and 100 are extreme outliers.*
- *If we apply a 20% trimmed mean (removing the bottom and top 10%), we remove the smallest 10% (24) and largest 10% (100).*

*Now, we calculate the mean of the remaining values:*

*[25, 27, 28, 30, 50, 29, 26, 31]*

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{25 + 27 + 28 + 30 + 50 + 29 + 26 + 31}{8} = 30.75 \text{ km/h}$$

✅ *The trimmed mean reduces the influence of the extreme outliers (50 and 100).*

**Example 2: Employee Salaries in a Company**

*Suppose we analyze monthly salaries (in $1000s) of employees in a company:*

*[30, 32, 35, 40, 100, 120, 150, 200, 250, 300]*

- *The top 20% of salaries (200, 250, 300) are outliers.*
- *The bottom 20% of salaries (30, 32) are low-end values.*

*After trimming, the remaining dataset:*

*[35, 40, 100, 120, 150]*

- *Mean before trimming: 125.7*
- *Mean after trimming: 89*

✅ *The trimmed mean gives a more realistic salary estimate by removing very low and very high values.*

[Trimmed mean  Code (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

### 🔥 Why Use Trimmed Mean?

- ✅ *Reduces the effect of outliers without completely ignoring extreme values.*
- ✅ *Useful for analyzing financial data, salaries, and sports performance.*
- ✅ *Better alternative than median when some extreme values exist but shouldn’t be completely ignored.*

### 2. Measure of Dispersion

📌 *What is Measure of Dispersion?*

*A measure of dispersion tells us how spread out or scattered the data points are in a dataset. While measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) give us a central value, dispersion helps us understand how much variation exists in the data.*

👉 *If the dispersion is low, data points are closely packed around the center.*
👉 *If the dispersion is high, data points are widely spread out.*

📌 *Why is Dispersion Important?*

- *Helps compare datasets (e.g., two different exam results with the same average but different variability).*
- *Identifies data consistency (low dispersion means stable results, high dispersion means fluctuating results).*
- *Detects outliers and anomalies.*

📌 *Common Measures of Dispersion*

- *Range – The difference between the maximum and minimum values.*
- *Variance – The average of the squared differences from the mean.*
- *Standard Deviation – The square root of variance, showing how much values deviate from the mean.*
- *Interquartile Range (IQR) – The range within which the middle 50% of the data lies (Q3 - Q1).*
- *Coefficient of Variation (CV) – A relative measure of dispersion, useful for comparing datasets with different scales.*

📌 *Example: Understanding Dispersion*

**Case 1: Low Dispersion (Consistent Scores)**

📊 *Exam scores of Class A:*

*[78, 80, 82, 79, 81]*

✅ *The scores are closely packed, meaning students performed similarly.*

**Case 2: High Dispersion (Varying Scores)**

📊 *Exam scores of Class B:*

*[55, 90, 72, 88, 45]*

❌ *The scores are widely spread, indicating large variations in performance.*


📌 *Dispersion Over Central Tendency*

*Central tendency (mean, median, mode) alone is not enough to describe a dataset. Two datasets can have the same mean but very different distributions, making dispersion crucial to understanding the spread of data.*

**Example: When Mean is Insufficient**

*Let's take two datasets:*

- *📊 Dataset A: [-5, 0, 5]*
- *📊 Dataset B: [-10, 0, 10]*

**Step 1: Calculate Mean for Both Datasets**

$$\text{Mean}_{\text{A}} = \frac{-5 + 0 + 5}{3} = 0$$

$$\text{Mean}_{\text{B}} = \frac{-10 + 0 + 10}{3} = 0$$


✅ *Both datasets have the same mean (0), but clearly, they are different in spread.*

**Step 2: Understanding Dispersion**

*Let's calculate some measures of dispersion to see the difference.*

1️⃣ *Range (Max - Min):*
$$\text{Range of Dataset A} = 5 - (-5) = 10$$
$$\text{Range of Dataset B} = 10 - (-10) = 20$$

✅ *Dataset B is more spread out than Dataset A.*

2️⃣ *Variance (Average Squared Deviation from the Mean):*

$$\text{Variance}_{\text{A}} = \frac{(-5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (5 - 0)^2}{3} = \frac{25 + 0 + 25}{3} = 16.67$$

$$\text{Variance}_{\text{B}} = \frac{(-10 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (10 - 0)^2}{3} = \frac{100 + 0 + 100}{3} = 66.67$$


✅ *Dataset B has a much larger variance, confirming it is more spread out.*

3️⃣ *Standard Deviation (Square Root of Variance):*
$$\sigma_{\text{A}} = \sqrt{16.67} \approx 4.08$$
$$\sigma_{\text{B}} = \sqrt{66.67} \approx 8.16$$

✅ *Dataset B has twice the standard deviation of Dataset A, indicating higher dispersion.*

🔍 *Conclusion: Why Dispersion Matters*

- *Mean alone fails to differentiate between Dataset A and Dataset B.*
- *Dispersion measures (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation) tell us how much the data is spread out.*
- *A larger dispersion means more variability in the data.*

[Code Example (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)


### i) Range: The Simplest Measure of Dispersion

🔹 *What is Range?*

*The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives a quick idea of how spread out the data is but does not consider how the values are distributed.*
$$\text{Range} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value}$$

📌 *Example*

**Dataset A (Small Spread):**

*📊 10, 12, 14, 15, 16*
$$\text{Range} = 16 - 10 = 6$$

**Dataset B (Large Spread):**

*📊 5, 10, 15, 20, 100*
$$\text{Range} = 100 - 5 = 95$$

👉 *Dataset B has a much larger range, but this is because of an outlier (100), which makes the spread misleading.*

📌 *Problem with Range: Sensitivity to Outliers*

*Consider two datasets:*

1️⃣ *Without Outlier: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25*
$$\text{Range} = 25 - 5 = 20$$

2️⃣ *With Outlier: 5, 10, 15, 20, 100*
$$\text{Range} = 100 - 5 = 95$$

🔴 *Issue: The range changes drastically if we have an extreme value (outlier), even though most of the data points are similar.*

✅ *Solution: Instead of range, we use Interquartile Range (IQR), Variance, or Standard Deviation, which handle outliers better.*

[Range Code (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

📌 *Key Takeaways*

- ✅ *Range is simple to calculate and provides a basic idea of spread.*
- ✅ *Highly sensitive to outliers, making it unreliable for datasets with extreme values.*
- ✅ *Better alternatives: Interquartile Range (IQR), Variance, and Standard Deviation.*

### ii) Variance: Measuring Data Spread

🔹 *What is Variance?*

*Variance measures how far each data point is from the mean. It tells us how spread out the data is compared to the average value.*
$$\text{Variance} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N}$$

- *A small variance means the data points are close to the mean (less spread).*
- *A large variance means the data points are far from the mean (more spread).*

📌 *Example*

**Dataset A (Less Spread):**

*📊 10, 12, 14, 15, 16*

- *Mean = (10 + 12 + 14 + 15 + 16) / 5 = 13.4*
- *Variance = [(10-13.4)² + (12-13.4)² + (14-13.4)² + (15-13.4)² + (16-13.4)²] / 5 ≈ 5.04*

**Dataset B (More Spread):**

*📊 5, 10, 15, 20, 100*

- *Mean = (5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 100) / 5 = 30*
- *Variance = [(5-30)² + (10-30)² + (15-30)² + (20-30)² + (100-30)²] / 5 ≈ 1260*

👉 *Dataset B has a larger variance, indicating a higher spread in data.*

[Variance Code (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

🔍 *Population vs. Sample Variance*

*There are two types of variance calculations depending on whether we have the full dataset (population) or just a sample.*

1️⃣ *Population Variance (σ²)*

*If we have data for the entire population, we divide by N (total number of values).*
$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$

2️⃣ *Sample Variance (s²)*

*If we only have a sample from the population, we divide by (n-1) instead of n.*
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

👉 *But why (n-1) instead of n? 🤔*
- *Think about it yourself, and if you don't get it, check this [hint link](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/variance-definition/).*

### iii) Standard Deviation: A More Intuitive Measure of Spread

🔹 *What is Standard Deviation?*

*Standard Deviation (SD) measures the spread of data by calculating how much the values deviate from the mean, just like variance. However, the problem with variance is that it is in squared units, which makes interpretation difficult.*

👉 *Standard Deviation is simply the square root of variance, bringing it back to the original unit of measurement.*
$$\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}}$$

📌 *Why Standard Deviation?*

- *Variance is squared, making it hard to interpret.*
- *Standard deviation is in the same unit as the original data, making it easier to understand.*
- *A higher SD means data is more spread out, while a lower SD means data is closely packed around the mean.*

📌 *Example*

**Dataset A (Less Spread, Low SD):**

*📊 10, 12, 14, 15, 16*

- *Mean = (10 + 12 + 14 + 15 + 16) / 5 = 13.4*
- *Variance = [(10-13.4)² + (12-13.4)² + (14-13.4)² + (15-13.4)² + (16-13.4)²] / 5 ≈ 5.04*
- *Standard Deviation = √5.04 ≈ 2.25*

**Dataset B (More Spread, High SD):**

*📊 5, 10, 15, 20, 100*

- *Mean = (5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 100) / 5 = 30*
- *Variance = [(5-30)² + (10-30)² + (15-30)² + (20-30)² + (100-30)²] / 5 ≈ 1260*
- *Standard Deviation = √1260 ≈ 35.5*

👉 *Higher standard deviation in Dataset B means the values are more spread out from the mean.*

🔍 *Population vs. Sample Standard Deviation*

*Since Standard Deviation is just the square root of Variance, we apply the same rules:*

1️⃣ *Population Standard Deviation (σ)*

*If we have data for the entire population, we divide by N:*
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$$

2️⃣ *Sample Standard Deviation (s)*

*If we have a sample from the population, we divide by (n-1) to avoid bias:*
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

[Standard Deviation Code Example (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

### iv) Coefficient of Variation (CV)

🔹 *What is Coefficient of Variation (CV)?*

*The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is a standardized measure of dispersion that allows us to compare the spread (variability) of two or more datasets, even if they have different units or scales.*
$$\text{CV} = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\text{Mean}} \times 100\%$$

*Why do we need it?*
- *Standard Deviation alone cannot be used to compare datasets with different units or magnitudes.*
- *CV removes unit dependency and expresses variability as a percentage.*
- *Lower CV → Less variability*
- *Higher CV → More variability*

📌 *Example: Why CV is Important?*

*Let's compare two different datasets:*

| Dataset | Mean (µ) | Standard Deviation (σ) |
|---------|----------|------------------------|
| A: Heights of students (cm) | 170 | 10 |
| B: Salaries of employees ($) | 50,000 | 5,000 |

👉 *If we compare the standard deviations (10 cm vs. $5000), it doesn't make sense since their units are different!*

👉 *Instead, let's calculate CV:*
$$\text{CV}_A = \frac{10}{170} \times 100 = 5.88\%$$
$$\text{CV}_B = \frac{5000}{50000} \times 100 = 10\%$$

🔹 *Interpretation:*

- *Dataset A (Heights) has less variation (5.88%)*
- *Dataset B (Salaries) has more variation (10%)*
- *Even though the SD of salaries is much larger, heights have a smaller relative spread.*

[Coefficient of Variation (CV) Code Example (Jupyter Notebook)](../notebooks/02.%20Descriptive%20statistics.ipynb)

### v) Interquartile Range (IQR)

🔹 *What is Interquartile Range (IQR)?*

*The Interquartile Range (IQR) is a measure of dispersion that shows the spread of the middle 50% of the data. It is calculated as:*
$$\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1$$

*Where:*
- *Q1 (First Quartile) → 25th percentile (Lower Quartile)*
- *Q3 (Third Quartile) → 75th percentile (Upper Quartile)*
- *IQR represents the range between these two quartiles.*

🔹 *Why Do We Use IQR?*

- ✅ *More Robust Than Range: Unlike the range, which considers the minimum and maximum values, IQR focuses only on the middle 50% of data, reducing the effect of outliers.*
- ✅ *Better Than Standard Deviation for Skewed Data: If data is skewed, standard deviation may not be reliable. IQR gives a more accurate representation of spread.*
- ✅ *Helps Detect Outliers:*

*If a data point is below $Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ or above $Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$, it is considered an outlier.*




🔹 *Example: Understanding IQR*

**Dataset:**

*📊 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, 21, 25, 30, 40*

**Step 1: Find Q1 and Q3**

- *Q1 (25th percentile) = 9*
- *Q3 (75th percentile) = 25*
- *IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 25 - 9 = 16*

**Step 2: Detect Outliers**

* Lower Bound = $Q1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 9 - (1.5 \times 16) = 9 - 24 = -15$
* Upper Bound = $Q3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR} = 25 + (1.5 \times 16) = 25 + 24 = 49$



🔹 *Any data outside this range (-15, 49) is an outlier.*
🔹 *Since 40 is within the range, no outliers exist in this dataset.*
